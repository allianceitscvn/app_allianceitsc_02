## Examples

### Skeleton screen

Below is an example of a general-purpose skeleton used to represent a full screen layout while loading.
Although this version works for many use cases, consider creating page-specific skeletons for a more accurate loading experience.

<ComponentPreview name="SkeletonScreen" className="max-w-[600px] mt-4 mx-auto" />
